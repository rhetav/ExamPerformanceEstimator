## Overview
This project is aimed at predicting student performance based on a dataset containing academic scores, demographic details, and other influencing factors. The goal is to identify patterns and provide actionable insights that can improve educational outcomes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning models for prediction
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment using Flask (if applicable)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Flask (for API deployment, if applicable)

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/rhetav/StudentPerformanceIndicator.git
 cd StudentPerformanceIndicator
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and ensure it is placed in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing and model training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate model performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. (Optional) Deploy the model using Flask:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
